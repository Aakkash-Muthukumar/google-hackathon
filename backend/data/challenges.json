You are also given the first few terms of the original, complete sequence and the rule that governs the sequence (e.g., arithmetic, geometric, Fibonacci). Your task is to reconstruct the missing numbers in the corrupted sequence based on the given rule and the initial terms. The input sequence will be a list of integers, and the rule will be represented as a string (e.g., 'arithmetic', 'geometric', 'fibonacci').\n\nFor arithmetic sequences, the rule string will be 'arithmetic' and a separate integer representing the common difference will be provided. For geometric sequences, the rule string will be 'geometric' and a separate integer representing the common ratio will be provided. For Fibonacci sequences, the rule string will be 'fibonacci'.\n\nIf the input sequence is impossible to reconstruct based on the given rule and initial terms, return an empty list.",
