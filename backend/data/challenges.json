    "description": "Given a list of non-negative integers, find the largest sum of consecutive elements within the list that does not exceed a given threshold. The consecutive elements must be contiguous. If no such sequence exists, return 0. \n\nFor example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the threshold is 7, the largest sum of consecutive elements not exceeding 7 is 6 (2 + 4). If the list is [1, 2, 3] and the threshold is 0, the answer is 0.",
