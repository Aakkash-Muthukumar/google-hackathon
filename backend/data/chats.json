        "content": "Lists and tuples are both used to store collections of items, but they have key differences.\n\nLists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after they're created (add, remove, or modify elements). They're defined using square brackets `[]`.\n\nTuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed once they're created. They're defined using parentheses `()`.\n\nEssentially, use a list when you need a collection that might change, and a tuple when you need a collection that should remain fixed. Tuples are also generally faster than lists.\n\nTLDR: Lists are mutable (changeable) using `[]`, tuples are immutable (unchangeable) using `()`. Tuples are faster.\n\n\n\n",
