    Create a comprehensive lesson with the following details:
    
    Lesson Title: {lesson_title}
    Lesson Description: {lesson_description}
    Subject Area: {subject_area}
    Difficulty Level: {difficulty}
    
    IMPORTANT: Structure the lesson content into 4 equal parts with clear progress breakpoints.
    Adapt the content to the subject matter:
    
    **PART 1 (0-25%): Introduction and Basic Concepts**
    - Brief overview of what will be covered
    - Basic definitions and fundamental concepts
    - Simple examples to introduce the topic
    
    **PART 2 (25-50%): Detailed Explanation**
    - In-depth explanation of the concept with clear examples
    - More detailed examples appropriate to the subject
    - Step-by-step breakdown of concepts
    
    **PART 3 (50-75%): Advanced Examples and Practice**
    - Multiple practical examples demonstrating the concept
    - Intermediate-level examples
    - Common use cases and scenarios
    
    **PART 4 (75-100%): Exercises and Summary**
    - 2-3 hands-on exercises or activities for students to practice
    - Key takeaways and summary of important points
    - Common mistakes and how to avoid them
    - Further reading suggestions
    
    At the end of each part, include a clear progress marker:
    - After Part 1: "## ðŸŽ¯ 25% Content Complete"
    - After Part 2: "## ðŸŽ¯ 50% Content Complete" 
    - After Part 3: "## ðŸŽ¯ 75% Content Complete"
    - At the end: "## ðŸŽ¯ 100% Content Complete"
    
    Make the content engaging, beginner-friendly, and include plenty of relevant examples.
    For programming courses, include code examples.
    For art courses, focus on techniques, visual descriptions, and artistic concepts.
    For math courses, include formulas, calculations, and step-by-step solutions.
    For science courses, include explanations, experiments, and scientific concepts.
    
    Use markdown formatting for better readability.
    Keep the total content between 1000-2000 words.
    Ensure each part is roughly equal in length and content depth.
