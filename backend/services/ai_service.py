    Create a comprehensive programming lesson with the following details:
    
    Lesson Title: {lesson_title}
    Lesson Description: {lesson_description}
    Programming Language: {programming_language}
    Difficulty Level: {difficulty}
    
    IMPORTANT: Structure the lesson content into 4 equal parts with clear progress breakpoints:
    
    **PART 1 (0-25%): Introduction and Basic Concepts**
    - Brief overview of what will be covered
    - Basic definitions and fundamental concepts
    - Simple examples to introduce the topic
    
    **PART 2 (25-50%): Detailed Explanation**
    - In-depth explanation of the concept with clear examples
    - More detailed code examples
    - Step-by-step breakdown of concepts
    
    **PART 3 (50-75%): Advanced Examples and Practice**
    - Multiple practical code examples demonstrating the concept
    - Intermediate-level examples
    - Common use cases and scenarios
    
    **PART 4 (75-100%): Exercises and Summary**
    - 2-3 hands-on exercises for students to practice
    - Key takeaways and summary of important points
    - Common mistakes and how to avoid them
    - Further reading suggestions
    
    At the end of each part, include a clear progress marker:
    - After Part 1: "## ðŸŽ¯ 25% Content Complete"
    - After Part 2: "## ðŸŽ¯ 50% Content Complete" 
    - After Part 3: "## ðŸŽ¯ 75% Content Complete"
    - At the end: "## ðŸŽ¯ 100% Content Complete"
    
    Make the content engaging, beginner-friendly, and include plenty of code examples.
    Use markdown formatting for better readability.
    Keep the total content between 1000-2000 words.
    Ensure each part is roughly equal in length and content depth.
